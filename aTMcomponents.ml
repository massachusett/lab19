                Component Behaviors of an ATM Machine

The functions here represent the component behaviors that an ATM
machine can take, including: prompting for and acquiring from the
customer some information (choosing an action or entering an account
id or an amount); presenting information to the customer; dispensing
cash.

Implementation of these behaviors is likely to require some database
of accounts, each with an id number, a customer name, and a current
balance.

 type id = int

(* Possible actions that an ATM customer can perform *)
type action =
  | Balance           (* balance inquiry *)
  | Withdraw of int   (* withdraw an amount *)
  | Deposit of int    (* deposit an amount *)
  | Next              (* finish this customer and move on to the next one *)
  | Finished          (* shut down the ATM and exit entirely *)
